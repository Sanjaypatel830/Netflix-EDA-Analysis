Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

The EDA performed in this project involved several key steps:

1. Data Cleaning: Used Power Query to handle missing values, correct data types, and standardize categories.
2. Descriptive Statistics: Analyzed the distribution of show types, ratings, and release years to understand the overall data landscape.
3. Trend Analysis: Identified trends over time, such as the increase in content releases and the prevalence of certain ratings and categories.
4. Geographical Analysis: Examined the distribution of content by country to understand regional production patterns.
5. Category Analysis: Investigated the most common categories to highlight popular genres and content types.

This thorough analysis provided insights into the characteristics and trends of Netflixâ€™s content library, supporting data-driven decisions and strategies.
